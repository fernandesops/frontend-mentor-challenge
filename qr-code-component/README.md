## The Challenge

The challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Want some support on the challenge? Join our Slack community and ask questions in the #help channel.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the /assets folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in png static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to inspect the design in more detail it is available to buy from the challenge page on the platform.

You will find all the required assets in the /images folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a style-guide.md file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google Fonts

### Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

Initialize your project as a public repository on GitHub. This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, have a read through of this Try Git resource.

Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using Vercel. We've got more information about deploying your project with Vercel below.

Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.

Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as font-family and font-size.
Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
If you'd like to try making your project fully responsive, we'd recommend checking out Sizzy. It's a great browser that makes it easy to view your site across multiple devices.



### Useful resources

- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me for let the presentation of the content adapted to a specific range of devices without having to change the content itself.. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
